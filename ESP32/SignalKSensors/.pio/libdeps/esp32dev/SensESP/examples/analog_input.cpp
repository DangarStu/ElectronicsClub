  // (In the final output, on a gauge in Instrument Panel, for example, it will
  // look like a percentage from 0 to 100, but the official "unit"  in the
  // Signal K specification for a percentage is "ratio".)
  // See
  // https://github.com/SignalK/specification/blob/master/schemas/definitions.json#L87
  // for more details.
  //
  // First, calculate the multiplier. Since the total measurement range
  // is 730 "analogRead units", and that will be represented by a total
  // output range of 1.000 (from 0.000 to 1.000), divide 1.000 by 730 to
  // get the "value per analogRead unit": 1.000 / 730 = 0.00137
  //
  // To calculate the offset, multiply the analogRead units at Dark times
  // the multiplier: 120 * 0.00137 = 0.1644
  // and make it negative, because the final value for "dark" needs to be 0.000.
  //
  // Proof:
  // Dark = 120 analogRead units x 0.00137 = 0.1644
  //        0.1644 + -0.1644 = 0.000
  // Bright = 850 analogRead units x 0.00137 = 1.1645

  // to be used to display this value is "ratio". Also specify that
  // the display name for this value, to be used by any Signal K
