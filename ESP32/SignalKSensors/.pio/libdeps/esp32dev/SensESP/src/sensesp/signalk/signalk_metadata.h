 * specification must have a `description`, and where the key is a numeric value
 * it must have `units`". Thus, any paths that you output that are not
 * already part of the official Signal K specification should have these
 * two fields defined as metadata.
 * <p>Note that this structure is a subset of the complete meta model.
 * These are the most common properties. More complex strctures
 * can be created by creating a descendant class of SKMetadata and
 * overriding add_entry()
